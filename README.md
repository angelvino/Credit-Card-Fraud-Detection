# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a Logistic Regression model. The dataset used is highly imbalanced, containing both legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

# Features

*Data Preprocessing: Load, inspect, and clean the dataset.
*Data Analysis: Analyze and visualize transaction distributions and amounts.
*Under-Sampling: Balance the dataset by under-sampling legitimate transactions.
*Model Training: Train a Logistic Regression model.
*Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's accuracy on training and test data.
